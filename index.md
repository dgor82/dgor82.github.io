Dear Fellow Tech Enthusiasts,

After almost two decades on the business-side of software start-ups, I have come full circle and in 2022 reconnected with my teenage passion for hands-on coding and am now aspiring to become a Software Craftsman.

My currently evolving skills lie in developing business-related systems with .NET / C#, especially to support owner-led SMEs. Focusing on this particular niche allows for some synergy between my small-business background and evolving tech skills. 

While I have an intense curiosity to eventually learn other languages (Rust, Clojure and F#), the 'C# corner' has proven useful in my current start-up project and allows me to have fun and reliably get into Flow!

I am a signatory of the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) and a member of the [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/) with a particular soft-spot for the Indie and [Artisanal Software](https://www.markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html) movements.

On this page, I will share with you projects/insights/media/sentiments from my own, ongoing and open-ended journey to Software Craftsmanship. 
For my full bio/CV, see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-gorin-b848172/). 
For my C# style guide, see [CheckMade's Wiki](https://github.com/CheckMadeLtd/Wiki)

Last but not least, gratitude: aren't we lucky to live in an era where one can make a living by reconnecting with the inner child - with programming the closest thing to 'Lego for Adults'?
