Dear Fellow Tech Enthusiasts,

After almost two decades on the business-side of software start-ups, I have come full circle and in 2022 reconnected with my teenage passion for hands-on coding.

Main skills & interest lie in developing business-related systems with .NET / C#, especially to support owner-led SMEs. This particular niche allows for some synergy between my small-business background and evolving 'hard skills' in tech. More importantly, it's my sweetspot for having fun and achieving regular states of Flow - or, in short: 'Lego for Adults'! :-)

I am a signatory of the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) and a member of the [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/) with a particular soft-spot for the Indie and [Artisanal Software](https://www.markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html) movements.

On this page, I will share with you projects/insights/media/sentiments from my own, ongoing and open-ended journey to Software Craftsmanship. For my full bio/CV, see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-gorin-b848172/).
