After almost two decades on the business-side of software start-ups, I have come full circle to 'follow my bliss' and in 2022 reconnected with my teenage passion for hands-on coding.

Particular skills/interest lie in business-related backend programming with .NET / C# following 'Clean Code' and 'Clean Architecture' principles, functional style and the Domain-Driven-Design (DDD) approach. This particular niche allows some synergy between my experience in business and newly developing hard skills in tech. 

I am a signatory of the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org) and a member of the [London Software Craftsmanship Community](https://www.meetup.com/london-software-craftsmanship/) with a soft-spot for the [Artisanal Software](https://www.markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html) movement.

On this page, I share with you projects/insights/media from my own journey to Software Craftsmanship.
