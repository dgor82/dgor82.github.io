# Artisanal Inspirational Software Projects

I believe Mark Bernstein did a good job capturing the spirit of the Artisanal Software movement in his series of posts on [NeoVictorian Computing](https://www.markbernstein.org/NeoVictorian.html).

The following, beautiful and long-running software projects by independent developers (individuals or small teams) have been particularly inspiring for me as a developer (and, naturally, I am an active user of most):

* [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md): The defining knowledge-base tool of our time, supporting data sovereignty
* [MoneyWorks](http://www.cognito.co.nz): Seriously Good Accounting Software (in development for 30+ years!)
* [ANKI](https://github.com/ankitects/anki): Powerful, intelligent flash cards (Open Source)
* [MacFamilyTree](https://www.syniumsoftware.com/macfamilytree): Genealogy for Mac (Apple App of the Year 2022)
* [Things3](https://culturedcode.com/things/): Beautiful & simple personal task manager (in daily use!)
* [AlDente](https://apphousekitchen.com): Battery Management / Charge Limiter for MacBooks (supremely executed by David & Matthias in Vienna)
* [The Brain](https://www.thebrain.com): Unique 3D mind-mapping tool, 25+ years in the making
* [Telegram API](https://core.telegram.org/api): Comprehensive dev ecosystem & supportive community
* [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/): Visualize, analyze, and share ideas (with a very active, long-lived user community)
